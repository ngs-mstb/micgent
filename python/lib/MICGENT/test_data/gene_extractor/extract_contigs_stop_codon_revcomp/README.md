This test files were generated by temporarily editing Ariba code in
`assembly.py:_fix_contig_orientation()`, changing:

```
if to_revcomp.get(seq.id,0) > not_revcomp.get(seq.id,0):
```

into

```
if not to_revcomp.get(seq.id,0) > not_revcomp.get(seq.id,0):
```

That results in all contigs coming out as reverse-complemented relative
to what they would normally be after this function (same strand as the gene reference).
