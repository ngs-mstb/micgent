Note: This script is designed to run with the amount of memory detected by BBMap.
      If Samtools crashes, please ensure you are running on the same platform as BBMap,
      or reduce Samtools' memory setting (the -m flag).
Note: Please ignore any warnings about 'EOF marker is absent'; this is a bug in samtools that occurs when using piped input.
