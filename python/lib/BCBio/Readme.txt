Python GFF module copied from Blue Collar Bioinformatics scripts and modules.

Slightly modified by Andrey Tovchigrechko for JCVI Cloud Viral Browse (VICVB) module.

The goal was to package this modified code inside VICVB to avoid conflicts
with any possible upstream installation. It was also difficult to automatically
install upstream BCBio as a dependency due to some details of its setup.py.
